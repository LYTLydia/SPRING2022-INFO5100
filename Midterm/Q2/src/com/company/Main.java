//Abstract class has constants, members, method stubs and defined methods, interfaces has constants and methods stubs only.
//
//Abstract class's methods and members can be defined as any type of visibility, interfaces' methods and members can only be defined as public.
//
//Abstract class needs to have a concrete child class to define the abstract methods while inheriting, abstract can extend abstract classes and methods from the parent class without defining.
//And when interface class extends an interface class, it doesn't need to implement methods from the parent interface.
//
//A child class can only extend one abstract class, an interface can extend or implement several other interfaces.
//
//A child class can define abstract methods with the same or less visibility, an interface must define the methods with the same visibility.
//
//Interfaces cannot contain data files, abstract class can contain them.
//
//The speed of interface is slow and of abstract is fast.
